# Get Started

## Using Docker (recommended)

Ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed.<br>
Add this to your MCP Server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Wordle MCP (Python)": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--init",
        "-e",
        "DOCKER_CONTAINER=true",
        "ghcr.io/cr2007/mcp-wordle-python:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you get an error on Claude Desktop for the first time, just make sure to pull the image before running.<br>
> `docker pull ghcr.io/cr2007/mcp-wordle-python:latest`

## Installing via `uvx`

The quickest and easiest method to get started. Make sure to install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) before adding this in your configuration.<br>
Add this to your MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Wordle MCP (Python)":{
      "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "--from",
          "git+https://github.com/cr2007/mcp-wordle-python",
          "mcp-wordle"
        ]
      }
  }
}
```
